Write a Java class called LinkedList that represents a singly linked list.

The class should have the following properties and methods:

A private Node object called head that points to the first node in the linked list.

A private Node object called tail that points to the last node in the linked list.

A private integer attribute called length that represents the number of nodes in the linked list.

A nested Node class with the following attributes:

An integer attribute called value that stores the value of the node.

A Node object called next that points to the next node in the linked list.

A constructor that accepts an integer value as an argument and initializes the value attribute.

A constructor for the LinkedList class that accepts an integer value as an argument and performs the following tasks:

Create a new Node object called newNode with the given value.

Set both the head and tail pointers of the list to the newNode.

Set the length attribute of the list to 1.
